<h3>White Bread</h3>
<div class="image-container">

</div>
<h4 class="ingredients">Ingredients</h4>
<ul>
    <li>11 c. flour</li>
    <li>2 T. yeast</li>
    <li>6 T. sugar</li>
    <li>6 T. oil</li>
    <li>4T salt</li>
    <li>1 c. milk</li>
    <li>3 c. water</li>
    <li>Equipmet: kettle, large mixing bowl, large mixing spoon (wooden), 4 cup glass measuring cup, plastic wrap, dish</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Put water in a kettle and turn on to heat up.</li>
    <li>Put 4 cups of flour and all other dry ingredients into a very large bowl and stir to combine.</li>
    <li>Pour oil and milk into large glass measuring cup. If you don't have a large measuring cup, combine ingredients in a large bowl</li>
    <li>Start adding the 3 cups of hot water. When you only have about half a cup left, feel the water and keep stirring and feeling the mixed liquids as you add the water. If it's too hot, add a little cold water. If it's too cold add more of the hot water. It should be hot enough that you feel a reaction sticking in your finger, but not enough that you want to pull your finger out.</li>
    <li>Mix the liquids into the flour with a large spoon. I wuse a wooden spoon.</li>
    <li>Pour remaining flour into the bowl, stirring as you go along. When it's too hard to stir, add flour onto your spoon and scrape it clean. Start kneading. </li>
    <li>Stop adding flour or add more flour to get a consistency where it's no longer sticking to your fingers</li>
    <li>Knead about 10 minutes. You can't overknead when doing it by hand. You lift the bread onto it's end, pour oil-milk mixture onto it.</li>
    <li>Stop when it is satiny and it springs back right away when you press on it.</li>
    <li>Pour oil around the edge of the bowl. Spin the dough around in the oil to cover the dough and the bowl with oil.</li>
    <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and then a towel.</li>
    <li>If you are in a hurry, put it in a warm place.</li>
    <li>After it has doubled in size, punch it down and form it how you'd like to cook it: loaf, bread sticks, rolls, etc.</li>
    <li>Let it rise another 40 minuets before baking at 400 degrees in the oven for 20 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
